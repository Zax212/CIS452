1.what exactly is being output by Sample Program 1 (what is the meaning of the output values)?
	The output by program 1 is the pointer to the beginning of the shared memory section and a pointer to the end of the shared memory segment.

2.read the man pages; then describe the meaning / purpose of each argument used by the shmget() function call.
	key - The key for which to retrieve memory from or if the key is IPC_PRIVATE, allocate new memory and generate a new key to pair with it.
	size - the size of the shared memory to allocate or retrieve.
	shmflag - specifies how to handle either retrieving or allocating memory based on the flags passed here.

3.describe two specific uses of the shmctl() function call
	shmctl can be used to find the last time someone changed the shared memory. It can also be used to change permissions on the shared memory.

4.read the man pages, then use shmctl() to modify Sample Program 1 so that it prints out the size of the shared memory segment
